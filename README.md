A customized Discord bot riddled with fun features based on a clumsy maid character from a tactical roleplaying game. The source code provided is intended for educational purposes.

## :snowflake: Features

- Post preloaded videos or memes
- Image searching for booru websites
- Dice-rolling and similar randomized seed commands
- Text-manipulation commands (uwu!)
