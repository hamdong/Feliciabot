Feliciabot is a custom Discord bot with a quirky personality, themed after a clumsy maid character from a tactical roleplaying game. She brings interactive fun and helpful utilities to your server — all powered by .NET and Discord.NET.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- [C# (.NET 8)](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/)
- [Discord.NET](https://github.com/discord-net/Discord.Net)
- Docker for containerization

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hamdong/Feliciabot.git
cd Feliciabot
```

### Setup Environment Variables

Create a `.env.dev` file (for development) or `.env.prod` (for production) in the root directory:

```ini
DISCORD_TOKEN=your-discord-token-here
```

> 🛡️ Do **not** commit your token files or `.env` to version control.

---

## 🐳 Running with Docker

### Development

```bash
docker-compose --env-file .env.dev up --build
```

### Production

```bash
docker-compose --env-file .env.prod up --build -d
```

> 🛠️ The bot reads its token from an environment variable and will fail to start if one is not provided.

### Stopping the Container

```bash
docker-compose down
```

### Metrics

For metrics gathering, run once:

```bash
docker network create feliciabot-metrics
```

---

## 🧪 Local Development (without Docker)

If you're running from Visual Studio or `dotnet run`:

1. Create a `launchSettings.json` file under `Properties/`:

   ```json
   {
     "profiles": {
       "Feliciabot": {
         "commandName": "Project",
         "environmentVariables": {
           "DISCORD_TOKEN": "your-token-here"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

2. Or use a `.env` file with a tool like [DotNetEnv](https://github.com/tonerdo/dotnet-env) or load it manually.

3. Then run:

   ```bash
   dotnet run --project Feliciabot.net.6.0
   ```

## 📦 Deployment Notes

- Production containers should use `.env.prod` and be run in detached mode.
- You can build small Docker images by trimming the runtime image and avoiding unnecessary build artifacts.
