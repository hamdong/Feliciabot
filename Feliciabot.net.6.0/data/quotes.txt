My name is Felicia. I'm one of the very best maids from the Kingdom of—! Whoa! Sorry. Dropped my tea tray.
The outfits for the Order of Heroes are great. I love the fluttery white capes! Wish I could try one on.
Several of us back home have been in charge of looking after our master, Corrin. There's me—the maid—and my slightly older twin sister, and... who else? Oh yes, Gunter!
I do my best to carry a tea tray with poise and elegance. But, uh... I'll drop it every time!
So nice that you look out for us. I'd like to do some patrols too. I wouldn't mess it up—promise!
I'm not the best at making tea, but I'll make you some if you want. I... I hope you like it bitter!
Did you know that I'm from the Ice Tribe of my world? Now you do!
Oh no! I broke another plate!
I'll be sure to wake everyone up, first thing in the morning. You can count on it.
M-my master is an absolutely wonderful person!
I think I deserve a raise!
Does this please you?
Whoa, sorry... Flubbed that.
Happy to have this new power! I'll use it to do my best.
For my master!
Didn't expect that, did ya?
You're just a stain!
No mercy! Not from me!
Oh, I wish people would clean up after themselves!
Sorry, I can't really chat right now. Laundry and chores are backing up!
You make everything look so easy. How do you do it?
I'm actually more confident on the battlefield than I am in the kitchen.
Can I fight by your side in the next battle? I'm stronger than I look!
What do you like to do when you get a break?
I spend most of my time just getting better at my job.
Aww, thanks for inviting me over...and for not asking me to clean your room!
Thanks for always being so nice to me... You've never made me feel like a servant.
I know we're friends, but I'm still happy to work for you. Call me anytime!
I'll always walk by your side. And hopefully not trip you constantly.
Welcome home! Can I get you something? ...Oh! You wanted me instead?
Welcome home. I don't think I'll ever get used to the warm baths here...
Oh, thank you! If you ever need to cool off, I'll use my ice magic to help you.
Um... If it's OK with you, I'd like to stay a little longer...
You're so sweet to think of me.
We've got trouble!
Here goes nothing!
I'm gonna break you!
I won't mess this up!
All taken care of!
I'm actually a hardcore otaku who likes maids more than having three meals a day.
One moment you're sexually harassing me, and then gone the next... Just what are you thinking?
I play games which feature female maids and it turns me on so much.
You're a pervert who annoys me all the time.
You're always running ahead of me and teasing me.
I wanted to join hands with you since a long time ago! 
Why is my heart beating so fast?
Pathetic.
Hi!
Oof.
Yeet.
Big MEATY claws!
My body is ready.
Make sure to pick up Fire Emblem Fates at your nearest Nintendo retailer.
Touching is good.
War. War never changes.
Feeling a little chilly.
wat
Huh.
????
Hello.
Ya.
ICE to meet you.
Aiba sus.
Death.
Hello! You know who asked me to stop by and say hello? It was Corrin! And now... I've said it twice!
Oh! I'm so glad I found you! Here, take this! I made you a pot of tea! It's basically a miracle! Don't laugh—it took me 14 tries!
I've finally been able to do SOMETHING to repay you.
I'm such a klutz, but you're always so understanding and kind. I wanted to thank you for that. I've been working hard to be a good help to you, and I promise to keep doing my best!
*nervous laugh*
Okay!
Whoa.
Ready!
